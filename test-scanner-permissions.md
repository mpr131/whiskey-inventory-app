# Enhanced Barcode Scanner - Camera Permission Flow Test

## Implemented Changes

1. **Auto-request permissions on mount**
   - When scanner opens, immediately requests camera permission
   - No need for user to click a button first
   - Shows loading state while requesting

2. **Improved permission flow**
   - Shows loading spinner with "Requesting Camera Access" message
   - Automatically initializes scanner when permission is granted
   - "Try Again" button only appears if permission was denied

3. **Better UX**
   - Loading state with animated camera icon and spinner
   - Clear messaging during permission request
   - Smooth transition from permission request to scanner

## Test Steps

1. Open the scanner from the scan page
2. Browser permission prompt should appear immediately
3. If allowed: Scanner starts automatically
4. If denied: Shows permission denied UI with "Try Again" button

## Code Changes

- Added `isRequestingPermission` state
- Created `requestCameraPermission` function that runs on mount
- Updated UI to show loading state while requesting
- Scanner initializes automatically when permission is granted
